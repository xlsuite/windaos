Real estate for the crowdfunding age.
The intent of this project is to migrate the speculative nature of property investing away from the rental market to ensure affordable, stable, local housing. 
Pairing the DAO with a REIT will enable both stock & crypto trading in our fund which buys & operates desirable locations in cities around the world.
We'll use the fund to secure properties & build or renovate them for the use of our members.
Regional projects will draw from a library of community models that include sustainable design & leverage a participatory economy.

**Our next steps include:** 
 - Minting our first governance coin
 - Attract an advisory board and key hires
 - Produce a viability study
 - Validate the model with a crowdfunding ICO

**Larger Goals:**
 - Raise a capital fund for purchasing properties
 - Develop prototype community plans
 - Launch concept in a minimum of 5 cities in 3 countries
